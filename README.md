# Is this gem ready for Rails X?

**NOTE:** Currently, we only support Rails 4.

[Ready4Rails.net][http://www.ready4rails4.net/] lists many gems and shows whether they are ready
for the last versions of Rails or not. You can also paste your Gemfile to get
a one-click report of the status of your Gemfile gems.

## Thanks to

* all the people who report new gem statuses and add new gems to the site.
* [Amar Raja][https://github.com/amarraja] for implementing the feature allowing the users to paste their Gemfiles.
